            "Paragraph: Parkinson's disease is a progressive movement disorder of the nervous system. It causes nerve cells (neurons) in parts of the brain to weaken, become damaged, and die, leading to symptoms that include problems with movement, tremor, stiffness, and impaired balance. As symptoms progress, people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) may have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.\n",

            "Title: Parkinson’s and the brain\n",
            "Paragraph: Although many brain areas are affected in Parkinson’s disease, the most common symptoms result from the loss of neurons in an area near the base of the brain called the substantia nigra. The neurons in this area produce dopamine. Dopamine is the chemical messenger that transmits  signals in the brain to produce smooth, purposeful movement. Studies have shown that most people with PD have lost 60 to 80% or more of the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra by the time symptoms appear.\n",

            "Title: Parkinson’s and the brain\n",
            "Paragraph: People with PD also lose the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine—the main chemical messenger to the part of the nervous system that controls many automatic functions of the body, such as pulse and blood pressure. The loss of norepinephrine might explain several of the symptoms of Parkinson’s that are not related to movement, such as fatigue and blood pressure changes.\n",

Researchers do not yet know why Lewy bodies form or their role  in the disease. Some research suggests that the cell's protein disposal system may fail in people with PD, causing proteins to build up to harmful levels and trigger cell death. Additional studies have found evidence that clumps of protein that develop inside the brain cells of people with PD may contribute to the death of neurons.\n",

Many disorders can cause symptoms similar to those of PD, includingmultiple system atrophy,Lewy body dementia,progressive supranuclear palsy, andcorticobasal degeneration. These disorders are sometimes referred to as “Parkinson's-plus syndrome” or “atypical Parkinsonism” because they have the symptoms of PD plus additional features.

            "Paragraph: Motor symptoms may significantly improve at first with medication, but can reappear over time as PD worsens and the medications become less effective. When recommending a course of treatment, a doctor will assess how much the symptoms disrupt the person's daily activities and then tailor therapy to the person's condition. Since no two people will react the same way to a given drug, it may take time and patience to get the dose and combination of medications right. Even then, symptoms may not completely disappear.\n",

            "Title: Treating PD\n",
            "Paragraph: Carbidopa-Levodopa.The cornerstone of PD therapy is a medication called levodopa (also known as L-dopa). Levodopa can reduce the movement-related symptoms of PD, but it does not replace lost nerve cells or stop its progression. Nerve cells can use levodopa to make dopamine and replenish the brain's reduced supply. People cannot simply take dopamine pills because dopamine does not easily cross theblood-brain barrier, a protective lining of cells inside blood vessels that regulate the transport of oxygen, glucose, medications, and other substances in the brain. People with PD are given levodopa combined with another substance called carbidopa. When added to levodopa, carbidopa prevents the conversion of levodopa into dopamine except for in the brain. This stops or diminishes the side effects of  excess dopamine in the bloodstream, such as nausea. Carbidopa-levodopa is often very successful at reducing or eliminating the tremors and other motor symptoms of PD during the early stages of the disease. People may need to increase their dose of levodopa gradually for maximum benefit.\n",

            "Title: Treating PD\n",
            "Paragraph: Later in the course of the disease, people with PD may notice more pronounced symptoms before their first dose of medication in the morning and between doses as the period of effectiveness after each dose begins to shorten. People may experience sudden, unpredictable “off periods” where the medications do not seem to be working. Taking levodopa more often and in smaller amounts can help with this. People with PD should never stop taking levodopa without consulting their doctor because rapidly withdrawing the drug can have potentially serious side effects.\n",

            "Paragraph: Dopamine agonists. These mimic the role of dopamine in the brain and can be given alone or with levodopa. They are used most often in early-stage PD or in conjunction with levodopa in later stages. Many of the potential side effects are similar to those associated with the use of levodopa, including drowsiness, sudden falling asleep, hallucinations, confusion, dyskinesia, edema (swelling due to excess fluid in body tissues), nightmares, and vomiting. In rare cases, they can cause an uncontrollable desire to gamble, hypersexuality, or compulsive shopping. Dopamine agonist drugs include apomorphine, pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine.\n",

MAO-B inhibitors cause dopamine to accumulate in surviving nerve cells and reduce the symptoms of PD. These medications include selegiline and rasagiline. Studies supported byNINDShave shown that selegiline (also called deprenyl) can delay the need for levodopa therapy by up to a year or more. When selegiline is given with levodopa, it appears to enhance and prolong the response to levodopa. Selegiline is usually well-tolerated, although side effects may include nausea, orthostatic hypotension, and insomnia. The drug rasagiline is used to treat the motor symptoms of PD (with or without levodopa).\n",

The COMT inhibitor drugs entacapone, opicapone, and tolcapone prolong the effects of levodopa by preventing the breakdown of dopamine. They can decrease the duration of “off periods” of one's dose of levodopa. Side effects may include diarrhea, nausea, sleep disturbances, dizziness, urine discoloration, abdominal pain, low blood pressure, or hallucinations. In a few rare cases, tolcapone has caused severe liver disease, and people taking tolcapone should have their liver function monitored regularly.\n",

The most common lesion surgery is called pallidotomy. In this procedure, a surgeon selectively destroys a portion of the brain called the globus pallidus. Pallidotomy can improve tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia symptoms, possibly by interrupting the connections between the globus pallidus and the striatum or thalamus. Some studies have also found that pallidotomy can improve gait and balance and reduce the amount of levodopa people require, thus reducing drug-induced dyskinesias. Another procedure, called thalamotomy, involves surgically destroying part of the thalamus; this approach is useful primarily to reduce tremor.\n",

            "Title: Treating PD\n",
            "Paragraph: Carbidopa-Levodopa.The cornerstone of PD therapy is a medication called levodopa (also known as L-dopa). Levodopa can reduce the movement-related symptoms of PD, but it does not replace lost nerve cells or stop its progression. Nerve cells can use levodopa to make dopamine and replenish the brain's reduced supply. People cannot simply take dopamine pills because dopamine does not easily cross theblood-brain barrier, a protective lining of cells inside blood vessels that regulate the transport of oxygen, glucose, medications, and other substances in the brain. People with PD are given levodopa combined with another substance called carbidopa. When added to levodopa, carbidopa prevents the conversion of levodopa into dopamine except for in the brain. This stops or diminishes the side effects of  excess dopamine in the bloodstream, such as nausea. Carbidopa-levodopa is often very successful at reducing or eliminating the tremors and other motor symptoms of PD during the early stages of the disease. People may need to increase their dose of levodopa gradually for maximum benefit.\n",
            "\n",
            "Title: Treating PD\n",
            "Paragraph: Initial side effects of carbidopa-levodopa may include nausea, low blood pressure, restlessness, and drowsiness. Over long-term use of carbidopa-levodopa, a person may experience dyskinesia (involuntary movements such as twisting and writhing), hallucinations, or psychosis.\n",
            "\n",
            "Title: Treating PD\n",
            "Paragraph: Later in the course of the disease, people with PD may notice more pronounced symptoms before their first dose of medication in the morning and between doses as the period of effectiveness after each dose begins to shorten. People may experience sudden, unpredictable “off periods” where the medications do not seem to be working. Taking levodopa more often and in smaller amounts can help with this. People with PD should never stop taking levodopa without consulting their doctor because rapidly withdrawing the drug can have potentially serious side effects.\n",
            "\n",
            "Title: Treating PD\n",
            "Paragraph: Dopamine agonists. These mimic the role of dopamine in the brain and can be given alone or with levodopa. They are used most often in early-stage PD or in conjunction with levodopa in later stages. Many of the potential side effects are similar to those associated with the use of levodopa, including drowsiness, sudden falling asleep, hallucinations, confusion, dyskinesia, edema (swelling due to excess fluid in body tissues), nightmares, and vomiting. In rare cases, they can cause an uncontrollable desire to gamble, hypersexuality, or compulsive shopping. Dopamine agonist drugs include apomorphine, pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine.\n",

            "Title: Treating PD\n",
            "Paragraph: MAO-B inhibitors. These drugs block or reduce the activity of the enzyme monoamine oxidase B, or MAO-B, which breaks down dopamine in the brain. MAO-B inhibitors cause dopamine to accumulate in surviving nerve cells and reduce the symptoms of PD. These medications include selegiline and rasagiline. Studies supported byNINDShave shown that selegiline (also called deprenyl) can delay the need for levodopa therapy by up to a year or more. When selegiline is given with levodopa, it appears to enhance and prolong the response to levodopa. Selegiline is usually well-tolerated, although side effects may include nausea, orthostatic hypotension, and insomnia. The drug rasagiline is used to treat the motor symptoms of PD (with or without levodopa).\n",

            "Title: Treating PD\n",
            "Paragraph: COMT inhibitors. COMT stands for catechol-O-methyltransferase and is another enzyme that breaks down dopamine. The COMT inhibitor drugs entacapone, opicapone, and tolcapone prolong the effects of levodopa by preventing the breakdown of dopamine. They can decrease the duration of “off periods” of one's dose of levodopa. Side effects may include diarrhea, nausea, sleep disturbances, dizziness, urine discoloration, abdominal pain, low blood pressure, or hallucinations. In a few rare cases, tolcapone has caused severe liver disease, and people taking tolcapone should have their liver function monitored regularly.\n",

            "Paragraph: Anticholinergics. These drugs, which include trihexyphenidyl, benztropine, and ethopropazine, decrease the activity of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and can be particularly effective for PD tremor. Side effects may include dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, hallucinations, memory loss, blurred vision, and confusion.\n",

            "Title: Treating PD\n",
            "Paragraph: Amantadine. This antiviral drug can help reduce symptoms of PD and levodopa-induced dyskinesia. It can be prescribed alone in the early stages of the disease, and can be used with an anticholinergic drug or levodopa. After several months, amantadine's effectiveness wears off in up to half of the people taking it. Amantadine's side effects may include insomnia, mottled skin, edema, agitation, or hallucinations. Researchers are not certain how amantadine works in PD, but it may increase the effects of dopamine.\n",

            "Processing paragraph: Carbidopa-Levodopa.The cornerstone of PD therapy is a medication called levodopa (also known as L-dopa). Levodopa can reduce the movement-related symptoms of PD, but it does not replace lost nerve cells or stop its progression. Nerve cells can use levodopa to make dopamine and replenish the brain's reduced supply. People cannot simply take dopamine pills because dopamine does not easily cross theblood-brain barrier, a protective lining of cells inside blood vessels that regulate the transport of oxygen, glucose, medications, and other substances in the brain. People with PD are given levodopa combined with another substance called carbidopa. When added to levodopa, carbidopa prevents the conversion of levodopa into dopamine except for in the brain. This stops or diminishes the side effects of  excess dopamine in the bloodstream, such as nausea. Carbidopa-levodopa is often very successful at reducing or eliminating the tremors and other motor symptoms of PD during the early stages of the disease. People may need to increase their dose of levodopa gradually for maximum benefit.\n",
