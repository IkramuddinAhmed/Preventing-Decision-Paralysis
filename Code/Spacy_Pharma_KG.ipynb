Levodopa can reduce the movement-related symptoms of PD, but it does not replace lost nerve cells or stop its progression. Nerve cells can use levodopa to make dopamine and replenish the brain's reduced supply. People cannot simply take dopamine pills because dopamine does not easily cross theblood-brain barrier, a protective lining of cells inside blood vessels that regulate the transport of oxygen, glucose, medications, and other substances in the brain. People with PD are given levodopa combined with another substance called carbidopa. When added to levodopa, carbidopa prevents the conversion of levodopa into dopamine except for in the brain. This stops or diminishes the side effects of  excess dopamine in the bloodstream, such as nausea. Carbidopa-levodopa is often very successful at reducing or eliminating the tremors and other motor symptoms of PD during the early stages of the disease. People may need to increase their dose of levodopa gradually for maximum benefit.\n",

People may experience sudden, unpredictable “off periods” where the medications do not seem to be working. Taking levodopa more often and in smaller amounts can help with this. People with PD should never stop taking levodopa without consulting their doctor because rapidly withdrawing the drug can have potentially serious side effects.\n",

Many of the potential side effects are similar to those associated with the use of levodopa, including drowsiness, sudden falling asleep, hallucinations, confusion, dyskinesia, edema (swelling due to excess fluid in body tissues), nightmares, and vomiting.
